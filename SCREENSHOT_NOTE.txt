IMPORTANT: 

To complete the README, please take a screenshot of the application and save it as "screenshot.png" in the root directory.

The screenshot should show the main Playground tab with some text in the input field and the voice parameters visible.

This will make the README more visually appealing and help users understand what the application looks like.

After taking the screenshot, you can delete this note file.
