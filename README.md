## Voice Parameters

- **Stability (0-1)**: Controls how stable/consistent the voice is. Lower values (0.0-0.3) allow for more emotional range and variability, while higher values (0.7-1.0) make the voice more monotonous but consistent.

- **Similarity Boost (0-1)**: Controls how closely the AI adheres to the original voice. Higher values (0.7-1.0) make it sound more like the original speaker, while lower values (0.0-0.3) allow for more creativity but may sound less like the original voice.

- **Style (0-1)**: Controls style exaggeration of the voice. Higher values (0.7-1.0) amplify the style of the original speaker, making the voice more distinctive and characterized. Default is 0.0 (no style exaggeration).

- **Speed (0.5-2.0)**: Controls the speed of the generated speech. Lower values create slower speech (0.5 is half speed), while higher values create faster speech (2.0 is double speed). Default is 1.0 (normal pace).

You can test different combinations of these parameters using the "Test Settings" button to find the perfect voice for your needs.

## Tips for Best Results

- Use proper punctuation to guide the pacing and intonation of the speech
- Use the "Add Break" button to insert pauses of specific duration with `<break time="Xs" />` tags
- Break long texts into smaller paragraphs for better results
- Different voices work better with different models - experiment to find the best combination
- Use the "Test Settings" button to quickly hear how different parameter combinations sound
- For emotional speech, use lower stability values (0.1-0.3)
- For narration or audiobooks, use medium stability (0.4-0.6) and high similarity (0.7-0.9)
- For consistent voice assistants, use high stability (0.7-0.9)

## SSML Support

The application supports SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags for more control over the speech:

- `<break time="Xs" />` - Add a pause of X seconds (use the "Add Break" button)
- `<emphasis>text</emphasis>` - Emphasize text
- `<prosody rate="slow/medium/fast">text</prosody>` - Control speech rate
- `<prosody pitch="low/medium/high">text</prosody>` - Control pitch
